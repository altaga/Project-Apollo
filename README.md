### It includes a provenance service that Allows supply chain participants to collaborate on a transparent and trusted data platform.

# Welcome to Apollo

The Internet of Things is a great mover that connects people, places, and products.
With that it offers opportunity for huge value creation and capture. Microcontrollers, sensors, actuators, and telecommunications are embedded into the physical world transmitting data to the Internet.
It will explode in the coming years reaching Billions and Billions of Devices.

But it has two main problems and limitations, namely scalability and security.




The internet of things has been associated with major cyberattacks, often involving the abuse of vulnerable connected devices. Blockchains offer a tacit solution for this, which is implied by its essential architecture.



But the problem is scalability. Apart from communication solutions which are 5G and mesh networks, if we are gonna employ a blockchain, it has to be one with great speeds and easily scalable.

Although the market currently has several services such as Ubidots, Sigfox, AWS IoT and quite a lot of incumbents that can connect IoT devices to the Internet, create great UI’s, sensor readings and so forth, It lacks a way or paid service to join this to blockchains. For the current services that can provide an IoT+Blockchain
